# Rural-App
*Currently Under Development*

#### [Youtube Video presentation of the app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIjt7Hr8FI)

Rural-App is a mobile application for iOS users, with it users can make faster appointments for hospitals in Ecuador. 
The idea took place mainly because of the problem of long waiting hours (or even days) for making an appointment at public health centers of the country. 
The app is developed at the moment using a CRUD service in swift with sqlite3. The goal is to make the health care system in Ecuador faster and reliable, so that
users can have first class access to health care, check their health data with a quite nice user interface, manage their appointments at the hospitals and much more in view...
